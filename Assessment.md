# Assessment

The assessment of this **unit** will be embedded on the project/exercise portfolio and individual exam of each **B module**. The following percentages will be applied:
-	Probabilistic Design: 20%, 
-	Numerical Modelling: 25%
-	Marine Renewables / Dams, Dikes and Breakwaters / Floating and Submerged Structures: 55%

The assessment for **Computational Modelling** is tailored for each B module as follows:
-   **HOS-B1 Marine Renewables**: 
  - Stand-alone project on floating wind turbine. The description of the project can be found [here](./assets/projects/CIEM4210-Project-2025.pdf).
  - Specific questions in the multiple-choice exam
-   **HOS-B2 Dams, Dikes and Breakwaters**: 
  - Stand-alone project on structural analysis of a breakwater. The description of the project can be found [here](./assets/projects/CIEM4220-Project-2025.pdf).
  - Specific questions in the oral exam
-   **HOS-B3 Floating and Submerged Structures**:
  - Embedded chapters on the floating-submerged tunnel project. The description of the project can be found [here](./assets/projects/CIEM4230-Project-2025.pdf).
  - Specific questions in the oral exam
-   **OE44090 Introduction to Computational Dynamics of Offshore Structures**:
  - Stand-alone project on floating wind turbine. The description of the project can be found [here](./assets/projects/OE44090-Project-2025.pdf).
