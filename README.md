## 📚 Embedded Modules

This unit is part of all **Module B** courses in the Hydraulic and Offshore Structures track:

- **CIEM4210** – *Marine Renewables*  
- **CIEM4220** – *Dams, Dikes and Breakwaters*  
- **CIEM4230** – *Floating and Submerged Structures*  

It is also shared with the course:

- **OE44185** – *Numerical Methods for Offshore and Dredging Engineering* (ODE MSc program)

## 🧠 Course Overview

The focus of this unit is the **definition and analysis of numerical methods** to solve Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) governing hydraulic and offshore systems.

It is assumed that students already have basic knowledge of the following topics, acquired through the MUDE program:

- Basic numerical methods for **Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs)** (explicit/implicit)
- Basic understanding of the **Finite Differences Method** for static PDEs
- Basic understanding of the **Finite Element Method** for static PDEs

> ⚠️ A short recap will be provided during the course to refresh these concepts.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

Upon successful completion of this unit, students will be able to:

- **LO1:** Construct conceptual models representing hydraulic/offshore systems using:
  - Point masses  
  - Rigid bodies  
  - Rods and Euler-Bernoulli beams  
  - Geometrically non-linear rods  
  - Simple 2D geometries  

- **LO2:** Apply suitable **numerical methods** to solve the equations of motion under typical environmental loads (e.g. wind, waves, currents).

- **LO3:** **Implement** these numerical methods using tools like **Matlab**, **Python**, or others.

- **LO4:** **Analyze** and interpret results by:
  - Validating against analytical or experimental data  
  - Identifying the method’s range of applicability  
  - Evaluating errors and convergence of the solution
