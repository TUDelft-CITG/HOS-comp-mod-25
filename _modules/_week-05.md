At the end of this week you will be able to: <br>
Define numerical methods to perform a modal analysis of systems governed by Partial Differential Equations. This entails:<br>
<i>1. Characterize the modal properties of a system of PDEs</i><br>
<i>2. Define numerical methods that return characteristics eigenfrequencies and eigenmodes of a system of PDEs</i> <br>
<i>3. Analyze and justify the results</i><br>
