At the end of this week you will be able to: <br>
Define and analyze numerical methods to solve systems governed by Partial Differential Equations. This entails:<br>
<i>1. Define the system of PDEs that characterize the behaviour of structures composed by rods and beams</i><br>
<i>2. Define numerical methods to solve a system of PDEs</i> <br>
<i>3. Implement a solver for a system of PDEs</i><br>
<i>4. Analyse and justify the results</i><br>
