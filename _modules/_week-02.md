At the end of this week you will be able to: <br>
Defining and solving an Equation of Motion using the Lagrangian approach. This entails:<br>
<i>1. Recognize structural elements and understand their contribution in the Equation of Motion</i><br>
<i>2. Deriving the Equation of Motion using Lagrangian approach</i> <br>
<i>3. Solve Equation of Motion using numerical methods</i><br>
