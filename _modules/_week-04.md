At the end of this week you will be able to: <br>
Define and analyse numerical methods to solve systems governed by Partial Differential Equations in 2-dimensional domains. This entails:<br>
<i>1. Define the system of PDEs that characterize the behaviour of linear elastic structures in 2D</i><br>
<i>2. Define numerical methods to solve a system of PDEs</i> <br>
<i>3. Implement a solver for a system of PDEs</i><br>
<i>4. Analyse and justify the results</i><br>
