At the end of this week you will be able to: <br>
Define numerical methods to analyse systems governed by nonlinear Partial Differential Equations. This entails:<br>
<i>1. Define the formulation that characterizes the dynamics of structures subject to large deformations</i><br>
<i>2. Define numerical methods to solve nonlinear systems of PDEs</i> <br>
<i>3. Analyse and justify the results</i><br>
